# Single Page Resume

This is my resume generated by [assemble](http://assemble.io/)

The demo version can be found [here](http://nya.io/my-resume)

###How to get started.

First you need to install dependencies. run

```bash
npm install
bower install
```

You can preview the resume by running `grunt server` any time.

Define your own resume just need add a yaml file named personal-info.yml in src/data fold
The structure should be like this below:

```YAML
phone: 000-000-000
email: youremail@example.com
name: Your name
address: Your address
link: http://nya.io
github: https://github.com/lordfriend
stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/users/1696590/lordfriend
occupation:
  title: Current Occupation
  desc: src/content/occupation.md

skill:
  title: Skills
  desc: src/content/skills.md
```
Modify this config file with your personal data.

Modify the jobs-en.yml or create a new yaml file in data. If you create a new file. your will modify your pages/index.hbs. find jobs-en in the first line and change to your own config file name.

Then you can modify the jobs description file and its markdown.

After all files been modified. run the grunt task to finish the build

```bash
grunt build
```
